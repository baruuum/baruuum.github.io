An interesting measure that I've encountered in my research on polarization is the **coefficient of overlapping** defined as

$$ OVL(f,g) = \int_X \min\{f(x),g(x)\}dx, $$

where $ f $ and $ g $ are two density functions defined over the same region $ X $. The measure is quite intuitive in that it measures the overlapping region of two densities. If the densities are defined over disjoint subsets of $ X $, say $ X_f $ and $ X_g $, $ X_f \cap X_g = \varnothing $, then $ OVL(f,g)=0 $. Also, as the area under each of the densities has to integrate to one, $ OVL(f,g)=1 $ if and only if the two functions are equal almost everywhere. For the discrete case, we might write

$$ OVL(f,g) = \sum_{x\in X} \min\{f(x),g(x)\}, $$

with $ f,g $ being PMFs.

Another interesting measure, encountered in the literature on neighborhood segregation, is the dissimilarity index. Consider two populations $ A $ and $ B $, which are distributed over the same area. Suppose the area is divided into cells (e.g., census tracks) which we denote by $ x\in X $. The dissimilarity index is defined as

$$ D(f,g) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{x\in X} \left|f(x)-g(x)\right|, $$

where $ f(x)=n(x)/N $ and $ g(x)=m(x)/M $ with $ N $ and $ M $ being, respectively, the total number of individuals in group $ A $ and $ B $, and $ n(x) $ and $ m(x) $ are the number of individuals from group $ A $ and $ B $ which are found in cell $ x $.

Now, let us go back, for a moment, to the coefficient of overlapping. It is not difficult to see that for two non-negative real numbers $ a,b\in \mathbb R_+ $,

$$ \min\{a,b\} = \frac{1}{2}(a+b - |a-b|). $$

So rewriting $ OVL(f,g) $ using this formula, we obtain

$$ OVL(f,g) = \int_X \frac{1}{2}\Big(f(x)+g(x)-|f(x)-g(x)|\Big)dx = 1 - \frac{1}{2}\int_X|f(x)-g(x)|dx, $$

with discrete analog

$$ OVL(f,g) = 1-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{x\in X}|f(x)-g(x)|. $$

Thus, it turns out that $ D(f,g) = 1-OVL(f,g) $.

Another interesting property of $ OVL(f,g) $ is the following. Note that

$$ OVL(f,g) =\int_X \min\{f,g\}dx = \int_X \mathbb I(f<g)dF + \int_X\mathbb I(g<f)dG  $$

Thus, we have

$$ OVL(f,g) = E_F[\mathbb I(f(X)<g(X))] + E_G[\mathbb I(g(X)<f(X))], $$

where $ E_H(W) $ is the expectation of the random variable $ W $ under the distribution $ H $. Thus, the coefficient of overlapping shows the error rate when we would infer the true distribution of an observed data point $ x $, amongst the two candidate distributions $ f $ and $ g $, based on the decision rule of choosing the distribution with a higher density at each point.
