Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of [Sociology](https://sociology.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University, where I am an affiliate of the [Center for the Study of Inequality](https://inequality.cornell.edu/), the [Cornell Population Center](https://cpc.cornell.edu/), the [Cornell Center for Social Sciences](https://socialsciences.cornell.edu/), and the [Roper Center for Public Opinion Research](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/). I work on topics in political sociology, social networks, social mobility, and quantitative and computational methods.

My work has appeared in *American Journal of Sociology*, *Journal of Politics*, *Social Forces*, and *Sociological Science*. My current projects examine political polarization in the US, with a focus on both political beliefs and ideology-based network segregation, using data from surveys and online forums. In a separate line of research, I use network approaches to study the structure of worker flows in labor markets. I have received my PhD in 2020 from New York University.
