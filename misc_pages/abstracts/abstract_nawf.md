<h3 align="center"> <strong>Network Approaches to the Analysis of Worker Flows</strong></h3>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

We review recently emergeing network approaches to the analysis of mobility tables. It is shown how a switch in representation of mobility data---from table to network---led to the application of new models and algorithms, which enabled researchers to answer questions that remained elusive in the past. Multiple models are reviewed---including community detection algorithms, stochastic blockmodels, ERGMs, and latent space models---with discussions of their strength and limitations for the analysis of mobility flows.
