Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the department of sociology at New York University. I work on topics in political sociology, social networks, social mobility, and quantitative and computational methods.

My dissertation engages in the question of social integration of small and large social collectivities. On the national level, I study political polarization and integration in the contemporary US both in terms of political attitudes and ideology-based network segregation; on the smaller scale, my dissertation analyzes how ambiguity in multiplex role relationships shape the integration of naturally occurring communities.

Besides my dissertation, I am interested in network approaches to studying occupational mobility and in developing new models for the quantitative analysis of social phenomena.
